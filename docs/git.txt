LOCAL → REMOTE (Commit + Push)

One file

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status
git add docs\git.txt
git commit -m "Added git.txt to the repo"
git push origin main

------------------------------------------------

LOCAL → REMOTE (Commit + Push)

Whole branch (all files)

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Update branch"
git push origin main

------------------------------------------------

REMOTE → LOCAL (Pull)

Use this when GitHub has the newest changes and you want them locally.

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status


------------------------------------------------
Check Who Has the Latest kb.json

1) Go to the repo
cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb

2) Make sure you’re on main
git checkout main

3) Get latest info from GitHub (no changes yet)
git fetch origin

4) Check status
git status

How to read the result (this is the answer)

If you see

up to date with 'origin/main'
nothing to commit, working tree clean


→ LOCAL and REMOTE are the same

If you see

modified: kb.json


→ LOCAL has the latest kb.json

If you see

Your branch is behind 'origin/main'


→ REMOTE (GitHub) has the latest



Git — Who Has the Latest? (Local vs Remote) — Step by Step

3) Ask GitHub for the latest info (no file changes yet)
git fetch origin

4) Check who is latest (read the results)
git status


5) Decide who has latest

A) If you see modified: (example modified: docs/tickets.txt)
→ LOCAL has the latest for that file (you changed it locally)

B) If you see Your branch is behind 'origin/main'
→ REMOTE has the latest (GitHub has commits you don’t have)

C) If you see Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main'
→ LOCAL has the latest (you have commits not pushed)

D) If you see up to date with 'origin/main' AND working tree clean
→ They are the same (no one is newer)

That’s the full “who has latest” check.

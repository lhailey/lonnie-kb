LOCAL → REMOTE (Commit + Push)

One file

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status
git add docs\git.txt
git commit -m "Added git.txt to the repo"
git push origin main

------------------------------------------------

LOCAL → REMOTE (Commit + Push)

Whole branch (all files)

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Update branch"
git push origin main

------------------------------------------------

REMOTE → LOCAL (Pull)

Use this when GitHub has the newest changes and you want them locally.

cd C:\Projects\lonnie-kb
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git status

Git — Who Has the Latest? (Local vs Remote) — Step by Step

3) Ask GitHub for the latest info (no file changes yet)
git fetch origin

4) Check who is latest (read the results)
git status


5) Decide who has latest

A) If you see modified: (example modified: docs/tickets.txt)
→ LOCAL has the latest for that file (you changed it locally)

B) If you see Your branch is behind 'origin/main'
→ REMOTE has the latest (GitHub has commits you don’t have)

C) If you see Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main'
→ LOCAL has the latest (you have commits not pushed)

D) If you see up to date with 'origin/main' AND working tree clean
→ They are the same (no one is newer)

That’s the full “who has latest” check.

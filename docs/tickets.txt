Akram and Kevin Cert Questions:

Kevin confirmed certificates can be pushed to multiple tags using MobileView’s Wireless TagConfiguration templates as tags sync.
You can create a template, set the Wi-Fi, the credentials, the SSID, the application server address, and then you can attach a certificate.”

Kevin: “Now the trick is — and I’m still waiting for an answer from R&D or Product Management —
if you change the cert on the server first, will you still be able to communicate at the level to push down the cert to the tag.”

akram and Kevin Cert Questions:

Kevin confirmed certificates can be pushed to multiple tags using MobileView’s Wireless TagConfiguration templates as tags sync.
You can create a template, set the Wi-Fi, the credentials, the SSID, the application server address, and then you can attach a certificate.”

Kevin: “Now the trick is — and I’m still waiting for an answer from R&D or Product Management —
if you change the cert on the server first, will you still be able to communicate at the level to push down the cert to the tag.”

Update: 

I sent Jim this proposed resolution on 1/26 at 12pm:
I checked your system report logs (error.log) and found that 
the gateway service is having issues. Here is the log entry:

2026-01-13 12:02:10,453 ERROR <<gateway>>
[com.aeroscout.mobileview.gateway.gateway-web.vendor.aeroscout.engine.worker.ExciterTraceTableNotificationWorker] 
Could not stop the processing worker

Restarting the  MobileView Gateway services may clear the stuck processing worker and resolve the problem.
Please update me with your results.

Update

1/26 at 11:04 - I asked Jim to resend events for 2 months in csv format
System Report, Hugs Event was sent

Using a T15ms with a door contact, the zone status can be toggled successfully between \"Closed\" and \"Open.\"<br><br>The issue occurs because the dwell event condition is configured to trigger alerts only when the zone status is either \"Open\" or \"Closed.\" However, MobileView does not correctly enforce this condition and generates both alerts regardless of the configured zone status.<br><br><strong>Solution:</strong><br><strong>Defect ID:</strong> 108821<br><strong>Description:</strong> In MobileView Core, the zone status condition that determines whether an alert should be generated does not function correctly for events of the \"Dwell\" type.<br><br>This defect is resolved in MobileView version 5.8 MR1.<br><br><strong>Workaround:</strong><br>Design assumptions indicate that customers who want alerts based on zone status should select the Zone itself (and not the Exciter) when defining the event.<br><br>If it is necessary to include an exciter in the event conditions (for example, when the zone is large and contains multiple exciters, but only one is located near a door), the following workaround is recommended:<br>• Define an inner zone around the exciter and trigger alerts based on this inner zone.<br><br>If issues arise involving multiple zones, a more advanced workaround should be reviewed and discussed on a case-by-case basis."

After upgrading to version 5.6, running a similar one-year report caused the report service to crash.<br><br>Investigation revealed that the value of <em>maxNumOfResults</em> in MeasurementHistoryArchiveReport.xml had been increased from 50,000 records to 50,000,000 records, which exceeded the available JVM memory and resulted in an out-of-memory error.<br><br><strong>Solution:</strong><br>During initial troubleshooting, the report-service JVM maximum memory (XMX) was increased to 6144 MB, which resolved the immediate issue. However, this approach is not recommended and is unnecessary in most cases.<br><br>The correct and supported method for increasing the number of rows returned by a report is to use the JMX console under the asset-management service.<br><br><strong>Recommended Procedure:</strong><br>1. Open the JMX console for the asset-management service.<br>2. Navigate to <em>reportsJMXServiceImpl</em>.<br>3. Select <em>overrideReportMaxResults</em>.<br>4. Retrieve the report ID from the report XML.<br>5. Reload the report templates.<br>6. Set the required number of records for the report.<br><br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br>If an out-of-memory condition persists after applying the JMX override, the report-service XMX memory size may be increased temporarily as needed.<br><br>Be aware that MobileView upgrades override JVM memory settings, so any custom XMX value must be reviewed and re-applied after an upgrade.<br><br><strong>Reference:</strong><br>See attached screenshot for JMX configuration example.",

This behavior is expected in shared or adjacent environments.<br><br><strong>Mitigation for Seeing Neighboring Facility Tags:</strong><br>If unwanted tag visibility becomes an issue, it can be mitigated by changing the Gateway ID:<br><br>• Many facilities leave the Gateway ID at the default value (commonly ID 1)<br>• Assigning a unique Gateway ID (for example, 900 or 2000) ensures only local tags communicate with local gateways<br>• Tags from neighboring facilities will no longer appear after this change<br><br><strong>Firmware Observations:</strong><br>• T15e tags are the primary tag type in use<br>• Some tags observed at older firmware levels likely belong to neighboring facilities or are offline<br>• Latest firmware versions should be applied where applicable<br>• T15h tags were also identified and require firmware upgrades as needed<br><br><strong>Instant Notifier – Chrome Extension:</strong><br>The Instant Notifier is now delivered as a Chrome browser extension rather than a standalone application.<br><br>Key points:<br>• No separate application installation required<br>• Appears automatically when MobileView is open in Chrome<br>• Instant notifications pop up directly in the browser<br>• Recommended to inform users ahead of upgrades so they are aware of the UI change<br><br><strong>Wireless Tag Configuration – Certificate and Wi-Fi Management:</strong><br>Newer MobileView versions include the Wireless Tag Configuration feature, allowing centralized management of Wi-Fi settings and certificates.<br><br><strong>Capabilities:</strong><br>• Create one or more wireless configuration templates<br>• Define SSID and Wi-Fi credentials<br>• Specify application server address<br>• Attach root certificates to the configuration<br>• Assign configurations by tag category<br><br><strong>How It Works:</strong><br>• A wireless configuration template is created under Administration → System → Wireless Tag Configuration<br>• Templates are associated with tag categories<br>• As bi-directional tags sync, they automatically receive Wi-Fi and certificate updates from MobileView<br><br>This eliminates the need to update certificates tag-by-tag using Deployment Manager, which is especially beneficial in large environments.<br><br><strong>Important Consideration (Certificate Update Order):</strong><br>There is an open question regarding update sequencing:<br><br>• Whether server certificates should be updated before pushing certificates to tags<br>• Or whether tags should be updated first before server certificate changes<br><br>This is considered a \"chicken-and-egg\" scenario and confirmation from R&D / Product Management is pending.<br><br><strong>Current Best Practice (Pending Confirmation):</strong><br>• Prepare both old and new certificates in advance<br>• Update tags first using Wireless Tag Configuration<br>• Then update server certificates after tag updates complete<br><br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br>• Wireless Tag Configuration was not available in some early 5.7 releases but is present in this system’s version<br>• This feature significantly reduces operational overhead for large deployments<br>• Deployment Manager remains cumbersome for large-scale certificate changes and should be avoided when possible<br><br><strong>Status:</strong><br>System health, reporting structure, and integrations were validated and found to be operating correctly."

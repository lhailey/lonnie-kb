The customer is using Deployment Manager (iOS) version 5.6.8.4 with a T15e running firmware 2.4. When clicking the tag image and opening the three-dot menu, the Firmware Update option is missing. This previously worked after guidance provided in October. I reproduced the issue by rolling my own T15e back to firmware 2.4 and confirmed the firmware update option is no longer available.
